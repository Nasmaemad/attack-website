                </p>Your first written reference to either trademark in a document must include in writing the &reg; trademark symbol and must include "MITRE" preceding "ATT&CK".
                <p>Subsequent references in that same document need not include the "R" trademark symbol.

                    <li>A headline should always reference "MITRE ATT&CK" together (never only "ATT&CK").
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Always capitalize "ATT&CK" to distinguish it from the surrounding text.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Do not modify the trademark, such as through hyphenation or abbreviation. For example, "ATT&CK'd!", "Plan-of-ATT&CK", "ATTK".
